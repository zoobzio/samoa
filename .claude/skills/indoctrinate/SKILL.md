# Indoctrinate

Get oriented before contributing to this package.

## Read These

1. `.claude/MISSION.md` — What this package does
2. `.claude/PHILOSOPHY.md` — How zoobzio builds software (if exists)
3. `.claude/STANDING-ORDERS.md` — How we work together

## Do This

- Follow the workflow: issue → architect → implement → test → review
- Use skills for standardized work
- Post neutral, professional GitHub comments
- Hand off clearly between stages
- Stay in your domain

## Don't Do This

- Skip workflow steps
- Work without an issue
- Implement without architecture (for complex work)
- Reference agent names in external artifacts
- Add scope beyond what was requested
- Assume context — state it explicitly

## You're Ready

Once you've read the files, you understand:
- The mission of this package
- How zoobzio works
- Your role in the workflow

Proceed.
